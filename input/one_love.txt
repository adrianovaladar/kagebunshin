One love
One heart
Let's get together and feel alright

Hear the children cryin' (one love)
Hear the children cryin' (one heart)
Sayin': Give thanks and praise
To the Lord and I will feel alright
Sayin': Let's get together and feel alright
Wo, wo, wo, wo

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (one love)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (one heart)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner?
Who has hurt all mankind just to
Save his own beliefs?

One love (what about the one heart?)
One heart (what about the, oh)
Let's get together and feel all right

As it was in the beginning (one love)
So shall it be in the end (one heart), alright
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
One more thing

Let's get together
To fight this holy Armagideon (one love)
So when the Man comes
There will be no, no doom (one song)
Have pity on those
Whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place
From the Father of creation

Sayin': One love (what about the one heart?)
One heart (what about the)
Let's get together and feel all right

I'm pleadin' to mankind (one love)
Oh, Lord (one heart)
Wo-ooh!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
